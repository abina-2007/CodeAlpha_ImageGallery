Project Title: Image Gallery

Description:
I developed a responsive Image Gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The gallery displays images in a grid layout and allows users to click on an image to view it in a lightbox. It includes next and previous navigation buttons, hover effects, smooth transitions, and category filters. The project is fully responsive and works on different screen sizes.

Technologies Used:
HTML
CSS
